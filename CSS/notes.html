             Drawback of inline css
Inline css = It is time consuming
By writing css it was reuced in the code readability, that's why it introdiced internal css
when we write in css file ,it is call internal css
inside boday tag we write structure 
inside head tag write style tag , and inside the style tag write style css
for id we will ue #, for class name we will use (.)

Internal css = it will create conflict
first html will load then css then javascript
to find that element it will take , 

External css = we keep this sperate html file and css file  

it follow two principle
DRY - do not repeat yourself , means dont write same code again and again , but you use same code
SOC - seperation of concern, it will help to increase development skill
